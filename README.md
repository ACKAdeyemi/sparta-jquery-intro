#jQuery Intro

###Objectives

Learn how to use the jQuery library within a js document to make code cleaner and easier and to produce.

###TASK


### Installation 
Downloading via a zip file and cloning the Repo from Github

###REVIEW
I'm excited to start experimenting and coding jQuery as it seems to make life coding with Javascript much easier. My only reservation towards it is the fact that I now need to remember another syntax on top of Javascript, and I need understand how to use both in one document.
